Models tried

1. Sequential model without regularization
2. CNN with Global max pooling
3. Depthwise Conv2D
4. Dense network
5. Experimented with Batch norm and dropout values.

Accuracy:
Classwise accuracy is in the notebook.
Val accuracy = 40%
Parameters= 470,790

Given more time :

1. Try adding skip connections
2. Since the images are very small, the chances that powerful models like resnets and VGG overfitting is quite high.
3. Try reduce the parameters further
4. Adding cutouts
